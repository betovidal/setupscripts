# Retroarch setup

1. Patch the configuration file (will be included). In general I should be able to write directories for assets, libretro info and general, and very importantly, change the input driver to sdl2 (or else buttons will be messed up for PS4 controller)
1. Automatic imports are broken, manual import works better. By importing a "playlist" is created
1. To change the input of a specific core you have to load it and open a rom. After that go to the quick menu (F1 or a custom one) and tweak as desired. Remember to save the mapping changes for the core, not for the game
